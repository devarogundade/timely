# Timely

Timely is a cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure project on Fraxtal designed to supercharge smart contracts by enabling them to perform time-based automated tasks. At the core of Timely is our native token, Timely ($TML), which is used to pay for these time-based execution services. This innovation allows smart contracts to schedule both one-time and repeatable tasks, enhancing their functionality and flexibility.
